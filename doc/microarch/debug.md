# Debug Module

## Overview

The debug module implements a subset of the RISC-V Debug Specification, providing external debug support for the CoralNPU core. It allows a debugger to halt, resume, and single-step the core, as well as read and write core registers and memory.

## Architecture

The debug module is a standalone module that connects to the core via a dedicated debug interface. It communicates with an external debugger through a simple request/response protocol.

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of the debug module:

## Interfaces

The following table describes the internal hardware interfaces of the debug module:

## Command Protocol

An external debugger communicates with the debug module by reading and writing a set of memory-mapped Control and Status Registers (CSRs) over the AXI interface. These CSRs provide a communication channel to the debug module's internal registers.

### Write Operation

To write to an internal debug module register (e.g., writing `0x1` to `dmcontrol` at address `0x10`):

1.  **Poll for readiness:** Read the `status` CSR at `0x31014` and wait for bit 0 to be `1`.
2.  **Set address:** Write the target internal register address (`0x10`) to the `req_addr` CSR at `0x31000`.
3.  **Set data:** Write the data (`0x1`) to the `req_data` CSR at `0x31004`.
4.  **Initiate write:** Write the `WRITE` operation code (`2`) to the `req_op` CSR at `0x31008`.
5.  **Poll for response:** Read the `status` CSR at `0x31014` and wait for bit 1 to be `1`.
6.  **Check status:** Read the `rsp_op` CSR at `0x31010` to confirm the operation was successful.
7.  **Acknowledge response:** Write to the `status` CSR at `0x31014` to clear the response.

### Read Operation

To read from an internal debug module register (e.g., reading from `dmstatus` at address `0x11`):

1.  **Poll for readiness:** Read the `status` CSR at `0x31014` and wait for bit 0 to be `1`.
2.  **Set address:** Write the target internal register address (`0x11`) to the `req_addr` CSR at `0x31000`.
3.  **Initiate read:** Write the `READ` operation code (`1`) to the `req_op` CSR at `0x31008`.
4.  **Poll for response:** Read the `status` CSR at `0x31014` and wait for bit 1 to be `1`.
5.  **Check status:** Read the `rsp_op` CSR at `0x31010` to confirm the operation was successful.
6.  **Read data:** Read the result from the `rsp_data` CSR at `0x3100c`.
7.  **Acknowledge response:** Write to the `status` CSR at `0x31014` to clear the response.

## AXI CSR Interface

These registers are mapped into the CoralNPU CSR address space and are used to communicate with the debug module.

| 0x30810    | rsp_op     | After a command completes, the status result (e.g., SUCCESS, FAILED) is available here.                    |
| 0x30814    | status     | A read-only register to check the status of the debug module. Bit 0 indicates if the module is ready for a new request. Bit 1 indicates if a response is available. |

## Internal Debug Module Registers

The debug module implements a set of internal registers that are accessible to an external debugger via the AXI CSR interface. These registers are used to control and monitor the core.

| Address | Name         | Description                               |

The `command` register is used to issue abstract commands to the core.

| Bits    | Name      | Description                                                                 |

| 23:0    | control   | Command-specific control information.                                       |

## Abstract Commands

Abstract commands are used to perform complex operations on the core, such as reading and writing registers.

To issue an abstract command, the debugger writes to the `command` register. The `cmdtype` field specifies the type of command, and the `control` field contains command-specific information.

### Access Register Command (cmdtype=0)

The Access Register command is used to read and write core registers.

The `control` field for the Access Register command is formatted as follows:

| Bits    | Name      | Description                                                                 |
|---------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 16      | write     | 1 for a write, 0 for a read.                                                |
| 15:0    | regno     | The number of the register to access.                                       |

The register numbers are defined as follows:

*   `0x0000-0x0FFF`: CSRs
*   `0x1000-0x101F`: Scalar GPRs
*   `0x1020-0x103F`: Floating-point GPRs

## Command Examples

### Reading a GPR (a0)

1.  **Issue the read command:** Write to the `command` register (address `0x17`) with the following value:
    *   `cmdtype` (bits 31:24): `0x0` (Access Register)
    *   `write` (bit 16): `0` (read)
    *   `regno` (bits 15:0): `0x100A` (for `a0`)
2.  **Wait for completion:** Poll the `abstractcs` register (address `0x16`) until the `busy` bit (bit 12) is cleared.
3.  **Check for errors:** Read the `abstractcs` register again and check that the `cmderr` field (bits 10:8) is `0`.
4.  **Read the result:** If there are no errors, read the value of GPR `a0` from the `data0` register (address `0x04`).

### Writing a GPR (a0)

1.  **Write the value:** Write the desired value for GPR `a0` to the `data0` register (address `0x04`).
2.  **Issue the write command:** Write to the `command` register (address `0x17`) with the following value:
    *   `cmdtype` (bits 31:24): `0x0` (Access Register)
    *   `write` (bit 16): `1` (write)
    *   `regno` (bits 15:0): `0x100A` (for `a0`)
3.  **Wait for completion:** Poll the `abstractcs` register (address `0x16`) until the `busy` bit (bit 12) is cleared.
4.  **Check for errors:** Read the `abstractcs` register again and check that the `cmderr` field (bits 10:8) is `0`.
